Alright, let's do this. Time for a review to the tits.

### **Full Project Review: Rhiz.om**

### 1. Macro-level X-ray

This project aims to be a platfo◊rm for collaborative, persistent digital spaces driven by an AI-first development philosophy. The architecture is a minimalist monorepo with three core pillars: a Deno-based edge API, a Vite/React SPA frontend, and a sophisticated "prompts-as-code" system for steering AI agents. The current code is a bare-bones scaffold, mostly a proof-of-concept for client-to-server logging.

My gut feel on simplicity vs. sprawl is a solid **9/10**. The *philosophy* is radically simple, and the existing code honors that. The danger is that the sprawling, hyper-detailed documentation could lead to an over-engineered future if you're not disciplined.

### 2. Folder fly-over

*   **`api/`**: A minimalist Deno backend, currently serving only as a log sink for the frontend. Its beauty is in what's not there: no heavy frameworks, no complex ORMs.
*   **`docs/`**: The project's soul. It contains an exhaustive set of requirements, standards, and even a self-review. This is where the grand vision lives, and it's so far ahead of the code it's practically in a different timezone.
*   **`prompts/`**: The second engine of the project. A well-structured "prompts-as-code" system that treats AI instructions as version-controlled artifacts. It's mostly placeholders but the structure is excellent.
*   **`web/`**: A standard Vite+React SPA, notable only for its clever, self-contained client-side logger that forwards events to the `api/`.

### 3. Tiny-system scorecard

*   **Simplicity**: 9/10. The implemented code is trivial. The architectural principles (`system.standards.md`) are a masterclass in aiming for simplicity.
*   **Composability**: 7/10. The *idea* is highly composable (API, Web, Prompts are distinct). The code is too simple to truly judge, but the foundation is right.
*   **Testability**: 2/10. There are zero tests. The docs talk a big game about quality gates, but the code has no proof.
*   **Naming Clarity**: 10/10. `Being`, `Intention`, `rhiz.om`—the names are evocative, consistent, and opinionated. This is a system that knows what it is.
*   **Config Hygiene**: 8/10. Clean and purposeful. `deno.jsonc`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and the root `package.json` dev script are all tight and explicit.
*   **Observability**: 6/10. The client-to-server logging pipeline (`web/src/logger.ts` -> `api/routes/log.ts`) is a fantastic start. But the rich error handling from `rhiz.om-errors.md` is still just a document.
*   **Docs Usefulness**: 9/10. The docs are phenomenally useful for understanding the *vision*. They're almost useless for understanding the *current code*, because the gap is so vast.
*   **Bus-Factor**: 2/10. The docs and code have a single, very strong voice ("Orin", "svincent"). If that person vanishes, the project is in deep trouble, beautiful documentation notwithstanding.

### 4. Hotspots & smells

1.  **Gap between Vision & Reality.** The biggest issue isn't in the code, it's the chasm between the docs and the `src` folders. The docs describe a palace; the repo contains a single, well-made brick. This is an existential risk.
    *   **Refactor:** Pick *one* simple feature from the docs—like user onboarding (`rhiz.om-ui-onboarding-flow.md`)—and build it end-to-end. Make one small part of the dream real.

2.  **Zero Tests.** The `system.standards.md` file preaches quality gates, but `pnpm test` isn't even a script.
    *   **Refactor:** Add `deno test` to the `api/` and `vitest` to the `web/` workspace. Write one simple test for the `/api/log` endpoint. Make the standards document an honest one.

3.  **Manual Routing.** `api/serve.ts` uses `new URLPattern(...)` directly. This is fine for one route, but it will become a tangled mess of `if/else` statements.
    *   **Refactor:** Introduce a tiny, edge-friendly router like [Hono](https://hono.dev/). It aligns perfectly with the project's minimalist philosophy and will keep `serve.ts` clean as you add endpoints.

4.  **Type-Unsafe Logging Payload.** `api/routes/log.ts` uses `await request.json()` and then casts with `(browserLogger as any)`. This betrays the project's own schema-first principles.
    *   **Refactor:** Define a Zod schema for the `logEvent`. Use it to parse the request body, giving you runtime validation and static types for free.

5.  **Boilerplate Frontend.** `web/src/App.tsx` is the default Vite counter app. It has nothing to do with Rhiz.om.
    *   **Refactor:** Delete the counter. Scaffold the absolute-minimum layout from `rhiz.om-ui.md`: a persistent navbar and a placeholder for the chat panel.

6.  **Placeholder Prompts.** The `prompts/commands` directory is full of empty markdown files. This makes the prompt system feel hollow.
    *   **Refactor:** Flesh out one command, like `explain-code.md`. Give it a real persona and instructions so the `prompt-run` tool (once built) has something to actually execute.

### 5. Quick wins (do in ≤1 day)

*   [ ] **Validate log events:** Add a Zod schema in a shared types package and use it in `api/routes/log.ts`.
*   [ ] **Add a test:** Create `api/routes/log_test.ts` and test the happy path and a 400 error.
*   [ ] **Update `package.json`:** Add root-level `lint` and `test` scripts that run the commands in each workspace.
*   [ ] **Clean `web/src/App.tsx`:** Remove the Vite boilerplate and replace it with a single `<h1>Welcome to Rhiz.om</h1>`.
*   [ ] **Update `rhiz.om-architecture.md`:** The review doc (`2025-07-12-requirements-review.md`) correctly points out that Vite is at `7.0.4` while the architecture doc says `7.0.2`. Fix it. Show that the docs are truly living documents.

### 6. Strategic leaps (1–3 months)

*   **Build a Real Feature Slice.** Implement the full user onboarding flow. A user should be able to log in via Auth0, get a `@being` ID, and see their own empty space. This will force you to build out the data model, API endpoints, and basic UI components.
*   **Implement the `prompt-run` Wrapper.** The "prompts-as-code" concept is a core differentiator. Build the wrapper script described in `docs/requirements/system-prompts.md`. Make the AI an active participant in building the rest of the project.
*   **Establish the CI Pipeline.** Make the promises in `system.standards.md` real. Set up a GitHub Action that runs linting, type-checking, and tests on every push.

### 7. Orin’s parting mantra

Vision without velocity is hallucination. Ship something.
