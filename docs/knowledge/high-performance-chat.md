# Achieving Terminal-Level Performance in a Web-Based Chat Interface

> _Jul 15 2025 - ChatGPT o3 DeepResearch_

# Introduction

We are setting out to build a chat experience that feels less like a web page and more like a living command-line—instant, friction-free, and unmistakably alive.  Think bubbles that materialize the moment a user presses Enter, LLM replies that pour in token-by-token with no perceptible delay, and scroll performance so fluid it invites eight-hour work sessions without a hint of fatigue.  This isn’t polish for polish’s sake; it’s the foundation for trust.  When conversation is the primary interface, every millisecond either sustains flow or fractures it.

Our charter, therefore, is twofold.  First, architect a front-end that treats React as a means, not a leash: lean on list virtualization, memoized immutability, and judicious use of imperative DOM touches when the functional model can’t keep up.  Second, orchestrate a streaming pipeline—WebSockets, HTTP/2-driven SSE, or QUIC/WebTransport—thin enough that each token from the model rides the network on its own heartbeat.  Together these layers must converge on the litmus test I keep in mind: *does it feel like `cat /var/log/chat` on a local terminal?*  If not, we iterate.

Technically, we’ll borrow the best tricks from high-throughput terminals and design-first chat clients alike: batching writes in a `DocumentFragment`, offloading markdown rendering to a worker or WASM, and prizing GPU-friendly transforms for every micro-animation.  Yet the spirit remains uncompromisingly human: users should sense immediacy, clarity, and calm, even when multiple LLMs stream concurrently or a backlog scrolls beneath their cursor.

That’s the mandate.  Precision engineering in service of uninterrupted presence.  We’ll measure our success not just in FPS or p99 latency but in how naturally people stay with the conversation.

## Efficient Rendering and Scrolling

**Virtualize the message list:** For a chat used “all day, every day,” you need to handle potentially long histories without slowing down. List **virtualization** is a key technique: render only the messages currently visible (plus a small buffer) and omit off-screen messages. This drastically reduces DOM nodes and layout work, yielding a smoother experience. In practice, virtualization can improve render performance by an order of magnitude – on the order of *10–100× faster renders* and much less GC overhead. Major chat apps like Slack and Discord use virtualization to keep their interfaces snappy; they avoid re-rendering or keeping DOM elements for old messages until those messages scroll into view. By leveraging libraries like **react-window**, **react-virtual** or similar, you can efficiently handle thousands of messages with minimal performance cost.

**Minimize DOM updates and reflows:** Even with virtualization, updating the DOM efficiently is crucial for “terminal-like” responsiveness. Each new message (or chunk of streaming text) should be appended *incrementally* without re-rendering the entire list. In React, this means structuring your state updates so that adding a new message only impacts a small portion of the UI. Use keys on list items and consider `React.memo` for message components so that existing messages don’t rerender when new ones arrive. If you stream text token-by-token (like an LLM response), be careful about updating the DOM too frequently – excessive updates can trigger constant **reflows** (layout recalculations) and **repaints**, which will jitter the interface. One strategy is to **batch DOM operations**: accumulate multiple incoming tokens or lines and append them in one go. The developers of VS Code’s terminal found that using a `DocumentFragment` to batch DOM manipulations significantly reduced layout thrash. In other words, doing one larger DOM insertion for many chunks (e.g. a whole sentence) is better than dozens of tiny insertions for each character or token. Similarly, avoid forcing layout when updating the chat: for example, if you auto-scroll to the bottom on new messages, try using techniques that don’t constantly read/write layout values (like using CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth` or an overflow container that is simply scrolled to its max height, instead of manual measurements each update). By keeping new content *absolutely positioned* or otherwise outside normal flow until final placement, you can also mitigate reflow costs.

**Smooth, high-FPS scrolling:** To feel as responsive as a terminal, the chat window must scroll at 60+ FPS with no stutters. Virtualization already helps by keeping the DOM light (fewer elements to paint means smoother scrolling). Also leverage the browser’s optimized scrolling: use native scrolling on an overflow container rather than a custom JS scroller, as the browser can offload it to the compositor for better performance. Ensure that any animations (e.g. a “new message” highlight or slide-in) use CSS transforms or opacity (which are GPU-accelerated) rather than properties that trigger layout. For example, animating `transform: translateY()` for a message bubble is much cheaper than changing its `top`/`height` in DOM, which would force reflows. Keep an eye on **layout thrashing** – if you do need to measure DOM (e.g. to stick the scroll to bottom), do it sparingly and not during every frame of a scroll or stream update. A well-implemented virtualized list can maintain a steady framerate even with very large content, similar to how a terminal effortlessly handles thousands of lines by rendering only what’s needed. In fact, Slack’s team notes that virtualization was necessary to maintain smooth scrolling as their channels grew large.

## Low-Latency Streaming over the Network

**Use persistent streaming channels (WebSockets or SSE):** To get data **streaming in extremely quickly**, avoid the overhead of repeated HTTP requests. Instead, establish a live connection so the server can push new messages or token chunks to the client in real time. **WebSockets** are often the go-to solution here: they provide a full-duplex, low-latency channel ideal for chat apps. Once a WebSocket connection is open, the server can send data as soon as it’s available, and it reaches the client with minimal latency (no extra handshake per message). WebSockets are known to perform better than traditional HTTP polling for low-latency, high-frequency updates. In our case, that means as your LLM generates tokens, you can stream them over the WebSocket immediately, creating a character-by-character “typing” effect from the AI.

If bidirectional communication is not needed (i.e. the client only needs to receive data in real-time), **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** are a simpler alternative. SSE (via the EventSource API) keeps an HTTP connection open and pushes events as they come. This is essentially what OpenAI’s streaming API does. SSE is one-way and text-only, but it has auto-reconnect built-in and can be easier to set up for purely streaming outputs. However, note that browsers limit SSE connections (max \~6 per domain) and SSE is unidirectional, so with multiple concurrent LLM streams or lots of users, WebSockets (which multiplex messages on one connection) might scale better. In summary, **use WebSockets for a chat-like environment with real-time back-and-forth** – it’s designed for chat and collaboration use cases – whereas SSE can be used for simpler one-way streaming of model outputs. In either case, the result is a steady flow of data to the UI with no need for the user to hit refresh or the app to poll repeatedly.

**Optimize the streaming pipeline:** Using a streaming transport is step one; ensuring it’s ultra-fast is the next. Configure your server and network stack for **minimal buffering**. For instance, if using HTTP chunked responses or SSE, disable Nagle’s algorithm (at the TCP level) or use explicit flushes so that each chunk is sent immediately. In Node.js or Python, this means flushing the response buffer after writing each SSE event or data chunk. With WebSockets, you’ll want to send small messages frequently rather than batching too large a payload, to keep latency low. Each token from the LLM can be sent as its own message or in small groups. The trade-off is between throughput and overhead: sending every single character as a separate WebSocket frame might be overkill (frame overhead could become significant), but sending, say, 2–5 tokens per message can strike a good balance. The goal is that the *user sees the text appear virtually as soon as the model produces it*.

Also consider **binary vs text frames** for WebSocket: if you’re just sending UTF-8 text, text frames are fine. But if you wanted to get fancy (for example, compressing the tokens or sending some binary format), WebSockets allow binary frames too. In practice, enabling WebSocket per-message compression (which most WS libraries support) can significantly reduce bandwidth for large responses without harming latency much – compressed chunks still stream out incrementally. Just be mindful to monitor latency; compression might add a few milliseconds in processing.

For multi-user or multi-model scenarios, design the communication efficiently. If multiple models are generating outputs simultaneously for one user interface, you could either open multiple streams (one per model) or send all streams through one connection with identifiers. WebSockets give you the flexibility to multiplex logically (e.g., include a model ID or conversation ID with each message). SSE would require one EventSource per stream (up to the browser limit). Using one channel is simpler for the client, but you’ll need a way on the server to merge streams in a non-blocking way. Often, it’s easiest to just use separate connections or separate WS message types for each model. In any case, *concurrency* should be handled so that one slow stream doesn’t block the fast one. The backend service could spawn a separate thread or async task for each model’s generation, and push out tokens to the socket as they come. The client can then render each model’s response in its own bubble concurrently.

**Keep the pipeline warm:** Terminals feel instantaneous partly because there’s no setup delay per command – the connection to the machine is constant. Similarly, keep your connections alive for long sessions. Avoid reconnecting or negotiating new connections frequently. Use heartbeats or ping/pong on the WebSocket to keep it from timing out if idle. If using SSE, the browser will typically keep it open indefinitely, but you might need to handle reconnection logic in case it drops. Ensuring the real-time channel is robust means the user can chat continuously without hiccups or waiting for a new connection handshake. This is especially important for an app people keep open all day.

On the server side, if you have a distributed system, route the user’s requests such that they consistently use the same server or session for streaming, to avoid extra hops. Some implementations use an intermediary queue or pub-sub (e.g. server generates tokens and publishes to a Redis or NATS channel that the WebSocket server subscribes to). That can be robust for scaling, but be cautious about added latency – every link in the chain adds milliseconds. For ultimate responsiveness, the fewer indirections the data passes through, the better. A direct WebSocket from the client to the server process generating the text (or a process very close to it) will minimize delay.

## Optimizing the React Interface

**Architecting the UI for minimal re-rendering:** In React, frequent re-renders can become a bottleneck, especially if each incoming token triggers a state update. To avoid this, design your component structure wisely. For example, have a `<MessageList>` component that accepts an array of messages, and each `<Message>` as a sub-component. When a new message is added to the array, React will diff the list and only add the new DOM node for the new message – it won’t re-create all the previous message elements. You can help React by providing stable keys and by memoizing messages that don’t change. Since chat messages are immutable once sent, you can wrap the message component in `React.memo` so it skips re-render if its props (the message text, author, etc.) are the same. This way, when a new message arrives, React will add one component and leave the others untouched. The result is an update cost that stays constant (O(1) per new message) no matter how many messages are already in the list, which is crucial for keeping the interface feeling instantaneous.

**Streaming text without overwhelming React:** If you implement token-by-token streaming (like an LLM typing out a response), you might need a slightly different approach, because updating a React state for each token could still cause a lot of re-renders on the message component. One technique is to handle the streaming text output *imperatively*: e.g., use a `useRef` to a `<div>` inside the message component and append text to it via `element.textContent` or `innerHTML` as chunks arrive. This way, you aren’t updating React state on every token – you’re directly manipulating the DOM text node, which can be much more efficient for a high-frequency stream. React won’t mind as long as you do this carefully (maybe in an effect that listens to the stream). Essentially, you treat the message component as a shell that renders once when the message starts, and thereafter you imperatively fill its content. This is a bit against the “pure functional” grain of React, but it can dramatically reduce overhead when you truly need to stream at high speed.

Another approach is to batch tokens in state: for example, collect tokens for 50ms and then update the component state with the concatenated string. The user still perceives it as streaming (20 updates per second), but you’re not triggering a render for every single token if tokens arrive faster than that. Batching updates using `setState` with functional updates or using a library like React’s experimental `useTransition` can keep the UI fluid. The key is to avoid blocking the main thread. Under the hood, React batches state updates to multiple components in the same event loop tick, which helps. But if tokens arrive via a WebSocket very rapidly, you might need to add your own throttling (e.g., only process incoming messages in an animation frame loop).

**Web Workers for heavy work:** Since you mentioned *no restrictions, even WebAssembly*, consider offloading any heavy computations away from the UI thread. The chat UI should ideally do very little besides append text, scroll, and respond to user input. If, for example, you need to format the LLM’s response (say, rendering Markdown to HTML, or syntax-highlighting code blocks in the response), doing that in the main thread could introduce jank if the content is large. A **Web Worker** can handle such parsing in the background. You’d stream raw text to the worker and get back already-formatted HTML or a virtual DOM structure to patch in. This keeps the main thread free to maintain smooth rendering and input handling. Likewise, any AI-related computations happening client-side (maybe smaller ML models or some state management) can be offloaded. WebAssembly comes into play if you have algorithms that are performance-critical – for instance, a custom text diff, compression, or even running a tokenizer or small language model in the browser. WASM can outperform JS for heavy tasks, but use it where it counts (e.g., running a local model or a particularly heavy parsing algorithm) rather than for general UI updates. Remember that interacting with the DOM still has to happen on the main thread, so WASM can’t directly speed up DOM manipulation except by helping compute what to render more efficiently.

**Avoiding memory leaks and buildup:** A chat that’s open all day should remain as fast at 6pm as it was at 9am. This means being mindful of resource cleanup. Remove event listeners on cleanup (for instance, tear down the WebSocket or SSE when the component unmounts or the user navigates away, to avoid piling up multiple connections). If you cache any data (like keeping a large message history in memory), consider capping it or using pagination so that memory usage doesn’t grow unbounded. Virtualization will automatically help by not keeping an enormous DOM, but your JavaScript memory for the messages array could grow if you never discard anything. In a single long conversation, you likely don’t want to throw away messages, but maybe you could *summarize and prune* if a thread becomes extremely long (this is more of an AI application concern, though, and would alter what the user sees, so it might not be desired). At minimum, ensure that older messages (especially if they contained media or complex components) aren’t causing hidden memory retention (e.g., through closures or still-attached listeners). Efficient use of data structures and cleanup will prevent the “slowdown over time” effect and make the app reliable for continuous use.

## “Terminal-Like” Experience and Advanced Techniques

To truly rival a terminal’s speed, we can draw lessons from how terminal emulators achieve performance:

**Canvas rendering for extreme throughput:** The web terminal in VS Code was refactored from DOM-based rendering to **canvas** for a huge performance boost. By drawing text to a `<canvas>` rather than creating lots of DOM nodes, they eliminated the costly reflow/repaint of the browser’s layout engine. The result was a **5× to 45× increase in rendering speed** and big reductions in latency and power usage. In a chat UI, most frameworks use regular DOM for messages (which is usually fine), but if you needed to display text at *truly massive* speeds (for example, streaming thousands of lines very quickly), a canvas might be worth considering. You’d essentially paint the chat text (and bubble backgrounds, etc.) onto a 2D canvas. This approach means doing more work manually (handling text measurement, line wrapping, implementing selection/copy, etc.), so it’s a complex trade-off. But it completely sidesteps the DOM’s bottlenecks. Canvas is GPU-accelerated and you can control drawing at the pixel level, so you can update only the parts of the canvas that change, which is very efficient. In fact, modern canvas allows **OffscreenCanvas**, which lets you perform rendering in a web worker thread and output to a bitmap that gets posted to the main thread for display. That means you could have a separate thread drawing your text updates without ever blocking the UI/interactivity. This is exactly how some high-performance games and visualizations work in the browser, and it could be applied to chat if needed. For instance, if your interface is showing multiple AI agents talking *simultaneously* with a flood of messages, a dedicated rendering thread could keep up with the volume. That said, for most chat applications, DOM with good virtualization is sufficient – canvas is an overkill unless you truly hit the limits of DOM text rendering. It’s an ace up the sleeve for *unbelievably high performance* if needed, but comes at the cost of complexity.

**Intelligently throttle rendering when overwhelmed:** A terminal will drop frames if the output is faster than it can render (you might not literally see every character in a 10GB/s `yes` command output, but the terminal shows as much as it can). Your chat UI should have a strategy for backpressure as well. If an LLM suddenly streams a huge block of text in a fraction of a second, trying to render every single token update might actually make the browser choppy. To handle this, implement a **frame skipper or batcher**. For example, track the time since the last UI update and if a new chunk arrives too soon, you could decide to skip rendering that chunk if another update is coming shortly, or combine it with the next one. The Xterm.js project implemented a *“skip-frame mechanism”* to throttle refresh rate when consuming large output buffers. Essentially, they ensured the rendering didn’t try to exceed the monitor’s refresh rate or the browser’s ability – if data arrives faster, some is buffered and painted in the next frame, rather than each piece causing a separate paint. You can adopt a similar idea: use `requestAnimationFrame` to schedule updates of incoming text, so you’re syncing them to the display’s frame rate. If multiple tokens arrive within one 16ms frame, they’ll get drawn together in one batch. This way, even under heavy load, the UI remains fluid and responsive to user input (e.g., the user can scroll or click stop). The user’s perception is just that the text is streaming fast – they won’t notice if you dropped 5 redundant renders in between because the end result is the same text appearing quickly. The priority is maintaining interactivity (no freeze) and a consistently high frame rate.

**Being “lazy” where it counts:** Another principle for performance is doing less work until necessary. Slack’s engineers discuss “being lazy” in loading and rendering. In a chat app context, this means: don’t render or fetch things before the user needs them. For example, if your interface has multiple chat threads, only mount and render the active one; others can be loaded on demand when the user switches. If your chat supports images or rich content, you might delay loading those assets until they are about to scroll into view. This reduces the initial load and keeps the app feeling lightweight. Also, consider preloading data *just in time*. A terminal-style app might prefetch something when idle so that when the user triggers an action, it feels instant. If your user often triggers the next AI response immediately after the last, you could start warming up the next model or connection slightly before they even click (speculative, but possible if you have usage patterns). This kind of predictive optimization can shave off perceived latency.

## Backend and Infrastructure for Speed

Having a fast UI is one side of the coin; the other is ensuring your backend can deliver content swiftly. **Use a streaming-friendly backend setup:** If you’re using Node.js, frameworks like Express can send SSE events by writing to the response and flushing. For WebSockets, choose a library or server that is known for low latency (e.g. `ws` in Node, or any robust WS server in your stack of choice). Ensure that the network path has minimal overhead: for example, if you have a reverse proxy or load balancer, configure it to allow streaming. Some proxies buffer HTTP responses until complete – that’s a big no-no for SSE/streaming. You’d want to set headers like `Cache-Control: no-transform` and maybe specific settings for Nginx or HAProxy to turn off buffering for these endpoints. Similarly, if using HTTP/2, make sure your server isn’t buffering the response (HTTP/2 can actually multiplex streams nicely, which could be an argument for using SSE over HTTP/2 if you didn’t want a custom WS solution – you’d avoid the 6 connection limit because HTTP/2 can handle many streams on one connection).

**Geographic and network optimizations:** To make the interface feel instantaneous globally, deploy your services in a way that users connect to a nearby server. High bandwidth and low ping to the server will make the token-by-token arrival feel snappier. You might use CDNs for static content (so the initial HTML/JS/CSS loads fast), and for the dynamic stream, consider edge computing or regional datacenters. If you have the budget and design, placing the model-serving backend on the edge (or using something like Cloudflare Workers with WebSockets, if feasible) can cut down latency. In essence, the shorter the path and the fewer the network hops, the more “real-time” the chat will feel.

**Scalability without sacrificing performance:** A terminal serves one user typically, but your chat app might serve many. Design the system so that adding more users doesn’t degrade responsiveness. This often means a **pub-sub** or event-driven architecture on the backend. For example, user input could be published to a queue that an LLM service consumes, and the LLM’s token outputs stream back via a WebSocket to that user. If you have many simultaneous streams, ensure the I/O is asynchronous and non-blocking. Use backpressure signals if available (WebSocket readyState or buffering amount) to avoid flooding the client. The goal is that each user’s experience is isolated and fast. Monitoring will be important – track latency from token generation to token received by client. If anything is slow, use profiling or logging to find bottlenecks (it could be the model, network, or the frontend rendering). In a high-performance setup, you’ll likely tune TCP settings, HTTP keep-alive, and maybe use protocols like **WebTransport** (the emerging QUIC-based transport) in the future, which might offer some improvements over WebSockets in certain cases (though as of 2025, WebSockets are very capable for our needs).

Finally, **test under realistic conditions**. Use high-frequency dummy data to simulate an AI response and see if the UI keeps up. Profiling in the browser (DevTools Performance tab) will show if frames are being dropped or if scripting is taking too long. Likewise, measure the round-trip time for small messages through your pipeline. A truly “snappy” system will have optimizations at every layer – from using efficient data structures in code, to minimizing CSS reflow, to fast networks. By combining these techniques – **virtualized & batched rendering on the front end, and streaming, low-latency delivery on the back end** – you can build a web-based chat interface that feels as responsive and fluid as a native terminal application. The end result should be an experience where the UI never feels like a bottleneck: scrolling is effortless, outputs appear in real-time, and the interface can handle long sessions and heavy content without breaking a sweat. With careful engineering, web apps *can* achieve that instant, “no-lag” terminal feeling – as you implement these strategies, keep profiling and iterating to ensure you hit that benchmark of unbelievable performance. Good luck!
